        <h1>I went to Roosevelt.</h1>
        <p>I was six when we left Lima, so it’s not a surprise that the first physical memory I have of my school, Roosevelt, is the playground. It was enormous, and the ground was made of pure sand, likely a choice made in order to break the many falls that occurred within the reckless arena. The best part though, was the monkey bars. No matter what age you were, you gravitated towards them, attempting to get across, or watching the older kids do tricks--flipping upside down, getting across two at a time, etc. The monkey bars were a center point for me on the playground, but also were the setting of one of my favorite stories at the time about my brother Conrad.</p>
        <p> When Conrad was in elementary school, he would stop by the monkey bars at the end of the day and look through the sand below them. He knew that kids kept money in their pockets, and put together, or discovered, that when they flipped around on the monkey bars, that same money often came tumbling down just to get lost in the sand. If he spent enough time looking, he would find five to ten soles, and have the money to spend on afterschool snacks or candy.</p> 
        <p>He’s always been innovative; this story specifically describes his ingenuity perfectly, even at a very young age. It’s something that I remember stuck with me when I was younger and I wanted to be just like him, which continues to this day, but for plenty of other reasons to match.</p>
        <p> On this same playground is where I waited with my two best friends, Gioia and Conrado, for both of my brothers to get out of class. We played The Powerpuff Girls; I was Bubbles, Gioia was Blossom, and Conrado was Mojojojo, the villain. We all had older siblings who got out of class after us, so my memories are of us, each standing on our own platforms in the play castle, running from side to side, calling to each other and having the most amazing time just the three of us and our made up games. </p>
