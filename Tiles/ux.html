        <h1>I am a ux/ui designer.</h1>
        <p class="caption">This tile is meant to mimic a webpage with a scroll bar on the right. There are three sections within the 'page' representing the many directions you can go even within the ux field.</p>
        <p>Three years ago I had no idea what a ux/ui designer was. I didn’t know what they did, or even that they existed, and now I am trying to become one. It’s funny how jobs work in that way--when I was younger I wanted to be a veterinarian. This was based solely on the fact that I thought dogs and animals were very very cute, so it makes sense thatt somewhere along the line, I lost that career interest. In high school, going into college I thought I would work in television. I wanted to be a producer, which guided my choice in picking the majors I did: Screen Studies, and Design and Technology. The latter’s description online included career paths in television, but the work we ended up doing, and the work I enjoyed the most, didn’t lead me down that path. It took me in a whole other direction that has landed me here, where I am today, looking for ux/ui roles.</p>
        <p>Even now I think I know what I want to do, but really even the subcategorized career that is ux/ui has sub-sub, and sub-sub-sub categories that lead all over the place. The truth is, career is often ever changing, and all that pressure we feel trying to make a decision for what we want to do is put on us unnecessarily. It’s an important choice, yes, but I don’t feel like I’m left without options, or the ability to pivot, it’s just about enjoying the field you go into and being open to what’s out there, which is way easier said than done.</p>
