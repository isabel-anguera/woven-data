        <h1>I am not religious.</h1>
        <p class="caption">My mom always says we’ll be connected; me and her, and everyone we love. It gives me peace of mind, and although I’m not specifically religious, I do believe in something.</p>
        <p>In Peru we went to church on sundays, and then to Dunkin Donuts. It was such a treat--I would get the boston creme donut with yellow frosting and a smiley face, just like a present day emoji. Sometimes it would be sprinkles, but the smiley face was always number one. I can picture it clearly, even the inside of the store, but the church we went to...not so much.</p>
        <p>I’m not really that religious. I do believe in something though; I don’t really care what it is, but I like feeling connected to people. My mom, who knows my biggest fear is losing my family, tells me that we’ll always be connected, that we’re stuck with each other no matter what, even if it’s in a way we don’t understand now. It makes me feel better to think this; it insinuates the people I’ve lost are with me, and that our love stands for something even past when we’re gone. It implies the connections you make don’t just fall into oblivion, but last in one form or another. It’s a feeling of not being alone, being taken care of, which I like believing in.</p>
