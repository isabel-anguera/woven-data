        <h1>I went to JRDS.</h1>
        <p>On January 29th in our last year at James River Day School, I sat with my best friends, Caroline and Holly, on the swings. It was after school; some sort of event was going on and we had escaped to the empty playground. I remember it being serene, the sun setting really nicely. But I also remember feeling as if something were coming to an end. We were moving onto high school and we didn’t know what to expect, or even if we would all be going to the same place. We all felt this ‘something’ closing, and we made a promise to each other that we would come back to those same swings every year on that day, January 29th. We haven’t gone back, and we did end up at the same school for the first two years, but our friendship has stuck and we have fulfilled the goal of the promise and at least seen each other yearly. </p>
        <p>I think there are people who are meant to be in your life—Caroline and Holly, are two of those people for me. I was lucky enough to meet them so early on in life. In middle school we were inseparable—in our minds we ruled the school, even though that was definitely not the case. We were unapologetically ourselves when we were together, and that continues today. It’s the sort of friendship that, even if you don’t speak in years, picks up right where you left off. </p>
        <p>But I’ve been finding it hard to put our friendship into words. I feel the most at peace when I am with them; the endless questioning and self doubt that goes on in my head all the time ceases for those moments we spend together because something about them and what we have gone through; what they have done for me, makes me feel protected and safe. I know we’ll always be friends, and I will continue to admire them individually and together for the rest of my life. To Caroline and Holly, DTSBs for life, I love you! </p>
