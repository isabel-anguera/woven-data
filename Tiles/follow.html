        <h1>I am followed by 313 and follow 265.</h1>
        <p class="caption">For each person I follow or who follows me there is the equivalent of one woven stitch. The four sections are split between Instagram followers/following, and Twitter followers/following.</p>
        <p>I just recently gave up on trying to give more significance to the people I follow on social media than is necessary. Before a recent purge of my following list, even if I wasn’t friends with someone or if we had met just once briefly, I thought that following them online would serve as a way of remembering moments in my life, that this click of a button would signal a deeper relationship than was real. All it did was make me unhappy. The content I was seeing was essentially of strangers, and I felt like it was often me admiring them and feeling like an imposter, or pathetic as I got joy from being able to say that this was someone I was ‘friends’ with.</p>
